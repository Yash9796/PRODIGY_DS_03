# PRODIGY_DS_03 – Decision Tree Classifier for Prediction

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. 

For this implementation, the Titanic dataset was used to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset Used
Titanic Dataset – Kaggle

The dataset includes passenger information such as:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Gender (Sex)
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked Port
- Survival Status

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:

1. Handled missing values in the dataset
2. Converted categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values
3. Selected important features for prediction
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets

## 🌳 Model Used
Decision Tree Classifier

A Decision Tree model was trained using the training dataset to classify whether a passenger survived or not based on input features.

## ⚙️ Model Workflow
1. Import dataset
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature selection
4. Train-test split
5. Train Decision Tree model
6. Make predictions on test data
7. Evaluate model performance

## 📈 Results
The model was able to predict survival outcomes based on passenger attributes. Decision Trees help visualize decision-making rules and are easy to interpret.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding classification problems in machine learning
- Learning how Decision Tree algorithms work
- Model training and evaluation using Scikit-learn
- Importance of feature selection in prediction models

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees can be used to build predictive models. It provides insights into how demographic and behavioral data influence prediction outcomes.
